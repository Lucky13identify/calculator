1. The application supports keyboard input. When using the keyboard, a cursor
   appears on the screen. You can perform mathematical operations, including
   division, multiplication, addition, subtraction, and evaluation.

2. In case of incorrect input, the user is presented with a notification saying
   'Error expression. Try again!', which means that a specific error occurred
   during input, and it's recommended to try again.

3. To perform multiplication via the keyboard, use the 'X' key, also known as
   'Ð§'. It doesn't matter in which language the key is used; multiplication will
   work. This feature is designed for convenience, especially if the user
   forgets to switch keyboard layouts.

4. Keyboard focus indicators have been added to the styles to allow users to see
   which keys they are pressing. ![Hover](./imagesForReadme//Hover.png)

5. In the responsive design, the calculator's size, specifically its components,
   has been increased.
6. Deployment is available on Heroku.
